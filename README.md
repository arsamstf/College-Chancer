"# College-Chancer" 

The CollegeChancer program helps prospective college students estimate their chances of getting into top universities. It compares the user's GPA, SAT/ACT scores, and extracurricular involvement against the middle 50% statistics of top colleges. Users input their GPA, SAT score, ACT score, and whether they have strong extracurriculars. The program then evaluates these details against the requirements of each college and provides feedback on their chances. Colleges included are Harvard University, Stanford University, MIT, and more. At this current stage, there are only statistics for the three universities mentioned, and only a simple yes or no question to if the user has good extracurriculars. I am currently working on adding these complexities.

 Update:

 I added the functionality to search the web to find stats for the college of the user's choice. I also added a more specific way for the user to input their extra-curriculars.
